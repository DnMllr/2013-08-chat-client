THE PLAN:

foci.length = number of users.

foci is an object with keys as users, and their values as an array of arrays, storing their messages and dates added in pairs.



the first item in foci is it's position which is determined by x=cos((π*2)/NumberOfUsers)*r 
and y=sin((π*2)/NumberofUsers)*r

r is 1/3 the screen's height.
